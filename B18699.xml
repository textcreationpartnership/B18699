            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of the <hi>PEOPLE</hi> commonly Called QUAKERS, Relating to OATHES and SWEARING, Humbly Offered.</head>
            <p>IT is not unknown to this Nation, that ever since we were a People, it hath been our Principle not to Swear, make or take Oathes, which He who is the searcher of all Hearts knows, is no other than a Case of pure Conscience, in tender Compliance with the Mind of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (as we Apprehend) and of many Eminent Martyrs, and Men of Wisdom and Renown who Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against Oathes and Swearing in the Gospel-Day, and not any Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, Disaffection or Worldly Interest whatsoever on our parts; nor to shun any Office or Service due to King or Country that lies in our power to perform: We being really Willing and Desirous to Answer the Just and Good Ends of Law and Government, as a peaceable People fearing God, and for this Cause of not Swearing we have been exposed to great <hi>Sufferings</hi> and Inconveniences in our Persons and Estates, by tedious Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments, and Disabled from Receiving our due Debts, or defending our Just Titles or Properties; not suffered to give Evidence in Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature at Common or Civil Law, nor to Answer in Chancery or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, prove Wills or Testaments, or take Administrations, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in our Trades at Custom-House, or be admitted to our Lands, or Trusted in our Duties and Services in Courts Leet, and Courts Baron, but great Advantage is taken against us, because we so fear an Oath, as that we Dare not Swear; For which cause also our Children and Young Men are not Allowed their Freedoms in Cities or Corporations, when they have Faithfully served out their Apprentiships. Nor are we suffered to serve in Civil Offices, when thereunto duly chosen (but often Grievously Fined, tho we Refuse not the Office but only the Oath.) Nor admitted to give our Voices in Elections of Magistrates, and Parliament Members in divers Places, tho known to have Right thereunto as Free-holders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
